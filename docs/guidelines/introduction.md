# Introduction

RTA is on a Digital Transformation journey. As part of this initiative, RTA intends to create a digital ecosystem of microservices and APIs that will fulfill business needs and facilitate the delivery of digital services to the public. This ecosystem will be built on top of a common platform (API Gateway) that will provide a consistent API and event design across all RTA projects.

The goal of these guidelines is to document patterns and best practices to result in a consistent API and event design. This will allow for better developer and user experiences, across internal and external consumers of these services.

This document is a work in progress. It is intended to be a living document that will be updated as the project evolves.
