# Principles

RTA has a wide variety of business processes backed by multiple teams. A comprehensive set of guidelines covering all scenarios is difficult to achieve. Hence the recommendations below are intended to be a set of guiding principles that will help us achieve a consistent API and event design across all agencies and initiatives.

1. Design APIs and Events around business capabilities
1. Treat APIs as Products with an owner, cost and price
1. Follow a "Contract-First" strategy for APIs and Events
1. Centrally govern and gradually evolve API and Event Schema
1. Document APIs/Events using OpenAPI or AsyncAPI
1. Provision APIs and Events to be independently testable
1. Be liberal in what you accept, be conservative in what you send
1. Prefer REST APIs with JSON payloads primarily
1. Secured APIs and Events using OAuth2 tokens or mTLS certificates
1. Adopt Single Responsibility Principle for services
